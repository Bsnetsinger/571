Dynamic Nice Value Assignment

Bradley Snetsinger and Michael Fox

time.sh - basic nice value experiment

time2.sh - dual process dynamic nice value assignment

time3.sh - user controlled CPU% limiter

Once file permissions are set using "chmod 755 filename", time.sh and time2.sh simply run and
produce data. The third script will ask for a file, in this case, input "bubbleSort.c", and a percentage,
such as 75. It will then run and produce data in txt files on the desktop.
